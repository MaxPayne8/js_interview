<!-- These two <meta> tags are crucial for defining how a web page behaves and how content is interpreted by browsers.

1. <meta charset="UTF-8" />
Purpose: This tag specifies the character encoding used by the HTML document.

Explanation:

charset stands for character set, and UTF-8 is a popular encoding that can represent almost
any character from most of the world’s writing systems.

UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) is the most widely used character encoding on 
the web because it supports a wide range of characters, including special symbols and characters from 
different languages (e.g., Chinese, Arabic, emoji, etc.).

Why it’s important: Without this tag, the browser might not interpret characters correctly, 
potentially leading to garbled or incorrect text display, especially for non-ASCII characters. -->

<!-- 2. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
Purpose: This tag is critical for responsive web design. It controls how a web page is displayed on different devices, 
particularly on mobile devices.

Explanation:

name="viewport": Defines settings for the browser’s viewport (the visible area of a webpage).
content="width=device-width": Tells the browser to set the page’s width equal to the device’s screen width 
(i.e., responsive to the device’s size).
initial-scale=1.0: Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded. A value of 1.0 means no zoom; 
the page is displayed at 100% scale.
Why it’s important: Without this tag, mobile devices would typically display the desktop version of the website 
and automatically scale it down, which can make the content difficult to read and interact with. This tag ensures 
that the layout adapts properly to smaller screens, making it user-friendly on phones and tablets. -->
